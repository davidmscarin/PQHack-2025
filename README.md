# PQHack 2025 Winning Solution

This repository contains the QuantumAI code developed by the winning team of **PQHack 2025**. The solutions are based on the **[Qadence](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence)** module, a module for building quantum circuits using **PyTorch**.
PQHack 2025 presented six complex exercises focused on quantum computing and artificial intelligence. This repository includes our solutions for **the first four exercises**.  

**Team "ZSZ"**:
- Carlos Felgueiras
- David Scarin
- Lucas Almeida

**work in progress**: we are working on the solutions for the last 2 exercises
